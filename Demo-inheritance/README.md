## Getting Started

### Week4
- For "extends"
  - Attributes in Parent
    - if it is private, CANNOT inherit
    - if it is public, "this" is something like "alias", pointing back to "super"
  - Constructors in Parent
    - Even it is public, CANNOT inherit
    - Instead, child class calls parent constructor by "super"
  - Methods in Parent
    - if it is public, "this" is something like "alias", pointing back to "super"
    - if it is private, child class CANNOT access by "super"
    - Child class can "override" the same method in parent class

- Inheritance
  - Parent Class can hold its own attribute
  - Parent Class itself can create object
  - 

- Polymorphism
